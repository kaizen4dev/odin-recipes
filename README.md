# odin-recipes
This is simple recipe page(I think.)

This webpage created to practice HTML, git, and coding.
Therefore I'll just copy(or better: ask ai to write) random recipe from internet.
My primary focus will be creating website itself.

What I may use for this page(or pages):
- lists
- links(both, absolute and relative)
- images
- text(ofc)
